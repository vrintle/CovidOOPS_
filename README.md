# CovidOOPS_

This project is a web application which simulates registration and distribution of COVID vaccine.

The `main.cpp` file is the file which we have to run to use this application. If you have GCC compiler installed, then simply execute the following command in shell.

```
code_directory> g++ main.cpp
```

and then run the application file (`a.out`) which will be created in the code directory. You can also use any C++ compiler to directly run `main.cpp` on the console.

The three custom headers included in `main.cpp` are:

- admin.h
- menu.h
- user.h

These header files must be kept in the same code directory.

Thanks for using App!  :)
